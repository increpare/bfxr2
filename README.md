It's currently BETA, and new things should be coming to it, but the main addition right now is Obiwannabe's subtly wonderful footstep generator, ported from puredata to javsacript:

## Archaeology

I don't know if it's genetically related, but I believe that _why made a program called sound foley (which I haven't been able to get to work) which looks quite similar to Sfxr in design based on what I've seen of his _why's presentation of it.
The darling DrPetter made the program this is based on, Sfxr:

* http://drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html
The fabulous Tom Vian did a flash port of this, called as3sfxr

There's also a port of Sfxr to OS X that's quite loved by people (and was a little influential) called cfxr:
* http://thirdcog.eu/apps/cfxr
I did a mod of as3sfxr that introduced some new features, and called it as3sfxr-b:

After asking for feedback, I spent some time adding and changing more things, making something new. Which is Bfxr. Which is what you see on this page.

Code from
Bulk of coding of this version done by poor little me. In addition to code from Tom/DrPetter, code snippits were taken from
